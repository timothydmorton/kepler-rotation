===============

Estimating rotation periods from Kepler photometry.

In order to use the ``Kepler_Timeseries_Petigura`` class, you need to have the Kepler multi-quarter photometry files (available here) saved on your system, and the "KOI_PHOTOMETRY_DIR" environment variable set to the location of those files.
